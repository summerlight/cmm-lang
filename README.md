C--
===
C-- is a dynamic-typed scripting language inspired by Lua
## History
I wrote this code at 2010, at the time when I was completely ignorant about programming language design and its implementation. so I decided to study the internal structure of Lua, and redesign and reimplement it in my own way. 
I don't think it is actually usable in any sense, but it'd be a good reference if you want to know how compiler and virtual machine can be implemented. Its implementation is relatively very simple since the primary objective was just to study PL.
