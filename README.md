C--
===
C-- is a dynamic-typed scripting language inspired by Lua
## History
I wrote this code at 2010, when I was completely ignorant about programming language design and its implementation. so I decided to study the internal structure of Lua, redesign and reimplement it in my own way. 
I don't think it is actually usable in any sense, but it'd be a good reference if you have zero prior knowledge and want to know how compiler and virtual machine can be implemented. Its implementation is relatively quite straightforward since the primary objective was just to study PL.
